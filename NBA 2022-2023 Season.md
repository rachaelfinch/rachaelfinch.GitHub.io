<img src="images/NBAC.png?raw=true"/>

**Project description:** Have you ever had a conversation with someone who is a die hard sports fan? I am talking about that type of person whose seasons revolves around baseball, basketball, football, and hockey not spring, summer, fall, and winter. I am always surrounded by sports fanatics so I took this opportunity to understand the NBA more in depth and provide some data driven insights. 

### The Data

For this project, I used the 2022-2023 Player Stats: Totals dataset from [Basketball-Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2023_totals.html)

There was a total of 539 players, but with all the trades made this season, there were 680 rows. There were 32 columns which included stats such as shooting percentage for different shots, rebounds, assists, and turnovers and other informatin such as rank, team, and position. I used **Tableau** to create visualizations and a story to share my findings. The color scheme used is to differentiate the positions that the players are on each team. Dark blue = Centers, Orange = Power Forwards, light grey = Point Guards, dark grey = Small Forwards, and light blue = Shooting Guards.

### Major Findings

- Nikola Jokic and Domantas Sabonis outperformed many point guards regarding their total number of assists.
- Joel Embiid was the MVP for the 2022-2023 season with an average of 33.1 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 4.2 assists per game.
- Jayson Tatum led the league in total points scored, playing a total of 74 games during the season.
- LeBron James and Giannis Antetokounmpo are very similar performing players.
- The Centers led many teams in 3 point percentages.

### League MVP

Using this bubble scatter plot, the x and y axes represent average points per game and average assists per games, respectively. The size of the bubble correlates with the average number of rebounds per game.

### Leading Scorer

Looking at the first bubble plot for stats totals, we see that Jayson Tatum scored the most, 2225 points during the whole season. I went through the raw data and sorted the players by the number of games each player played. The maximum number of games played was 83 and the minumum was 1 game. Tatum played 74 games. While this is beneficial to the Celtics, it actually reduced his average points per game compared to other players like Joel Embiid and Luka Doncic who only played 66 games during the season. Reasons such as load management and injuries often reduce player's total games played.

### The Goat vs The Greek Freak

LeBron James is often referred to as "The Goat", however, I do not agree. Michael Jordan will forever be The Goat, but that is not part of this analysis. It is apparent in this data that both James and Antetokounmpo are highly performing power forwards. Antetokounmpo outscores and outrebounds James, but James has more assists per game. They are both fairly similar in size, Antetokounmpo is 6'11", 243 lbs, with a 7'3" wingspand and James is 6'9", 250 lbs, with a 7'0" wingspang. James is also 39 years old and has spent 21 years in the league while Antetokounmpo is on his 11th year in the league at the age of 29. The question is will Antetokounmpo be on the same level of play in 10 years? We will have to wait and see.

### Basketball Becoming Less Positional

Come March every year, the atmosphere around basketball always becomes more exciting. This intensre draw to the sport is usually fueled by the NCAA March Madness tournament. While completing this project, I found myself spending every night after work tuning into an NBA game.
