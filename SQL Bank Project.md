## Exploring Expansion of Transportation Through the Eyes of The World Bank

**Project description:** 
The International Development Association (IDA) section of The World Bank provides its recipient member countries with development credits and grants. The goal of the IDA is to help the world's poorest countries by providing credits (zero to low-interest loans) to reduce poverty. Grants are used to help countries create programs to meet their development needs, improve quality of life, and give the economy a boost. 

Throughout history, roads have been an innovative way to connect people. Before roads, think of the mode of transportation used. Typically, it was horse or by foot. The wheel was invented prior to paved roads, but it wasnâ€™t the most effective mode of transportation when there was heavy rain. With the introduction of paved or stone roads opened the door for the automotive industry to thrive as well as new technologies such as google maps and waze. Many underdeveloped countries today still do not have paved roads and thus, limited transportation. 

**The Data**
For this project, I downloaded the most updated IDA Statement of Credits and Grants available. This dataset was updated on February 15, 2024. It contains ~10.4k rows and 30 columns. Each row represernts a credit or a Grant. The columns represent different data elements such as: Credit Number, Country, Borrower, Credit Status, Service Charge Rate, Project Name, Original Principal Amount (US$), Due to IDA (US$), etc. The Data Dictionary for this data set can be shown in [**Data Dictionary for IBRD Statement of Loans and IDA Statement of Credits and Grants**](https://finances.worldbank.org/api/assets/FF2A5DB3-BBD2-444D-ADA8-90DF4A166980?download=true)

The data can be found following [**This Link**](https://finances.worldbank.org/Loans-and-Credits/IDA-Statement-of-Credits-and-Grants-Latest-Availab/ebmi-69yj/about_data)

I began exploring this dataset with simple queries using SQL (Standard Query Language). After learning what type of information I was working with, I decided to focus on a specific type of Project that these countries need loans for. There were options related to agriculture, education, water, and power. However, I decided to choose transportation routes such as roadways and highways as my project of choice.

### 1. You can have sections and text.

Just like this. And you can even add internal coding blocks

```sql
(' ')
```

### 2. You can add any images you'd like.
