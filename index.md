[<img src="Tab CF Ed.jpg?raw=true"/>]
In this case study from Data Analytics Accelerator, I was prompted to analyze education data from the state of Massachusetts. The main focuses were:
Determine the schools that have the lowest rates of graduation and those that are excelling.
Demonstrate how the makeup of a school's population may affect graduation rates.
Establish if class size impacts the likelihood students will go on to pursue a college degree.
Address fourth-grade Math proficiency levels and determine which districts lead the state in scores.
