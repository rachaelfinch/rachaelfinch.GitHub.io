### About Me

Hi! I am a northerner born and raised, but currently living in the south. I love the outdoors and recently have gotten more into running. I ran my first half-marathon this past January. My fiance and I have two Calico cats named Georgia and Luna, and I love to cook and code! Follow for more of the latter.
